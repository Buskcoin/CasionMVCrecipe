MVC Slot Machine

Create a slot machine that adheres to the MVC design pattern. The view will be styled as a typical casino slot machine with three reels. 

Each reel must have 3 different possible images that randomly chosen when the user pressed the spin button. Depending on the amount of matching reels, the user will bet and possibly win credits.

two matches from left to right : 2 x wager
three matches from left to right : 3 x wager

The slot machine will also have three buttons: Spin, Bet One, and Cash out.

Spin will cause the reels to randomize until an arrangement is chosen. 

Bet one will increase the user's bet by one.

Cash out will exit the program. 

There are three requirement for this program:

All the calculations to what the user wins will be handled in the model. 

All user controlls will be carried out in the Controller class.

All the GUI aspects of this program will be handled in the View class.
